A Sudoku Game

Can be Played with different difficulties levels(easy, medium and hard) and under different time limit (3 min, 5 min, 10 min)
One can also change the theme to dark mode.

Start Game after selecting parameters and click on 'Get New Puzzle'.

The timer would start and one can have only 3 lives to complete the board.

When you put a wrong num in the sudoku board where it should not be then your lives would reduce by 1.

If either the timer becomes zero or lives become zero then a message will appear as 'You Lost!'

One can also cheat while playing using 'Solve by own' button, which will complete the whole board in no-time.

When the whole board gets completed(solved), the timer would automatically stop and the message will pop-up as 'You Won!'
